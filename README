Data::Predicate

This is a library inspired by Apache Commons Collection Predicate library
and google-collections Predicate library (both Java libraries). Predicates
are transportable logic objects which boil down to a true/false response. 

A number of predicates have already been built allowing for the combination
of multiple predicates (and), partial matching (or) or reverse logic
(not). These mixed in with more complex & Perl centric ideas (defined, number
isa) allows us to build very complex logic in portions and then 
build a final logic Object to represent the boolean concept.

Predicates are not meant to replace normal if statement logic; more to 
supplement it.

Data::Predicate is the core class & default implementations are available
from Data::Predicate::Predicates.

In time this module may develop an XS library but for the moment it is written
in PurePerl (for better or worse).
